#Scraping Homework

These are the files for part 1 and 2 of the Scraping Homework for the Lede 2025 Program.

## Assignments

* [Part 1] (US Presidents) - Data scraping of the list of US presidents.
* [Part 2] (News) - Scraping news data from Le Monde.

Obs: I still haven't been able to do parts 3 and 4 because I had a lot of difficulty with the Le Monde part and needed to seek help. I intend to go back and complete them later, updating on GitHub. Sorry!
